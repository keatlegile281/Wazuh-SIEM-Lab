# Wazuh-SIEM-Lab

# Wazuh SIEM Lab Deployment (Linux VM)

## Overview

In this project, I built a small SIEM lab using virtual machines to learn how security monitoring works in a real environment. I deployed a Linux virtual machine as a test endpoint and installed a Wazuh OVA appliance as my SIEM server. The purpose of this lab is to simulate system activity and verify that security events are detected and logged correctly.

This setup allows me to practice basic SOC skills such as log monitoring, alert verification, and troubleshooting.

## Lab Environment

### Requirements

To build this lab, I used:

* A host computer with virtualization support
* Virtualization software
* A Linux ISO image
* The Wazuh OVA file
* At least 6–8 GB RAM recommended for stable performance

---

## Deployment Steps (Simplified)

### 1. Creating the Linux Virtual Machine

I created a Linux VM to use as my test machine.

* I opened my virtualization software and created a new virtual machine
* I selected Linux as the operating system
* I assigned at least 2 CPU cores, 2–4 GB RAM, and 20 GB storage
* I attached a Linux ISO and completed the installation
* After setup, I updated the system:

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

This VM generates activity and logs for my SIEM lab.

### 2. Importing the Wazuh OVA

I deployed the SIEM server using the Wazuh OVA file.

* I used the **Import Appliance** option in my virtualization software
* I selected the Wazuh.ova file
* I assigned 6–8 GB RAM and at least 2 CPU cores
* I started the VM and waited for it to fully boot
* I noted the IP address shown on the screen

I accessed the dashboard in my browser using:

```
https://<Wazuh-VM-IP>
```

### 3. Verifying Services

After booting the SIEM VM, I checked that services were running:

```
sudo systemctl status wazuh-manager wazuh-dashboard wazuh-indexer
```

If needed, I restarted them:

```
sudo systemctl restart wazuh-manager wazuh-dashboard wazuh-indexer
```

This ensured that the SIEM backend was functioning properly.

## Testing the SIEM

### Privilege Escalation Test

To confirm that my SIEM setup was working, I generated authentication events on the Linux endpoint.

Steps I performed:

1. I opened the Linux terminal
2. I ran:

```
sudo su
```

3. I intentionally entered the wrong password several times
4. Then I entered the correct password to gain root access

This action generated authentication logs that were sent to the SIEM server.

---

## Checking Alerts in the Dashboard

To verify detection, I:

1. Opened the Wazuh dashboard in my browser
2. Navigated to:

```
Security Events → Events
```

3. Set the time filter to the last 15 minutes
4. Reviewed authentication alerts generated by my test

Seeing these alerts confirmed that log collection and monitoring were working correctly.

## Conclusion

Through this project, I successfully deployed a working SIEM lab using virtual machines. My Wazuh server collects logs from a Linux endpoint and generates alerts based on system activity. This lab provides a foundation for practicing security monitoring, testing attack scenarios, and improving my SOC analysis skills.

I plan to expand this environment by adding more endpoints and simulating advanced security events.
